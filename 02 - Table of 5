## 02 - Table of 5

### Hint

You have to print the table of 5 like:
    
5 X 1 = 5
5 X 2 = 10
......

You can use whatever or just use 2 variables.

### Help

We will use the for loop here. It is used to iterate through a list, string, set, tuple, dictionary or a range of numbers. If you do not know about it, go to:

Learn here, it has a lot of stuff and to learn.

### Solution

1. Create variables

m = 5

2. Make a variable n and make it run through the range of 1 to 10, then make it print the result

for n in range(1,11):
    print(f"{m} X {n} = {m * n}")

All together, it is: 
    
m = 5
for n in range(1,11):
    print(f"{m} X {n} = {m * n}")

Wow, this was a new concept. So, this is all. And learn more, spread your branches.
