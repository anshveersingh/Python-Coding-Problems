## 00 - Taxes Payed

### Hint
You are living in a kingdom which was ruled by a cruel king. He imposed heavy taxes on all. You are the minister and you only know how to code. You want to help people. Every one has the same income; which is 100. Make a program that takes the first input as the tax rate, and display the taxes payed on the screen.
    
### Help
input() returns string, not an int. So, use the eval() function to evaluate to the correct data type.

### Solutions

The solutions are - 

1. First, we need to input that, so:

tax_rate = eval(input("Enter the tax_rate: "))

2. Calculate it, so:

taxes_payed = tax_rate * 100
    
3. Display it, so:

print("The taxes payed are: {}".format(taxes_payed))
    
[Note: You can use any format to do the above. ]

And so, the total code is:
    
tax_rate = eval(input("Enter the tax_rate: "))
taxes_payed = tax_rate * 100
print("The taxes payed are: {}".format(taxes_payed))


Done! You have practiced about some arithmetic, variables, print formatting and how to take input. And if you practice more and more, so.. you can be a great programmer. Do not program for money, program to change the world....
