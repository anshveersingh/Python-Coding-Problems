## 01 - Calculate the average

### Hint

Given two numbers, calculate their average (input them). But.... you can not use any third variable. You have to only display the result, not store it.

### Solutions

1. Input them.

a = eval(input("Enter the first number: "))
b = eval(input("Enter the second number: "))

2. Calculate it and print it.

Here, we will be using the f - string literal.

print(f"Their average is {a + b / 2}.")


So, that was it. You may have a different solution, but this is the basic. The first step is the hardest, but the nexts are easier. You have learned how to use f - string literals. Congrats! And keep learning..
